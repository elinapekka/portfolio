                This project was done as a part of the <span style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}>Introduction to Digital Design</span> -course in the Fall of 2021, 
                where the aim was to familiarize ourselves with HTML and CSS. We got to do a project of our choice as
                the end project, and I decided to do a website for the company Jarpec, where I utilized different 
                design princples to create a user-friendly website. In the website, responsive design and 
                many different types of boxes/containers are utilized.

                I have since learned a lot and can see that there are many things to improve on, but at the time I was
                very happy with my work. I remember this time of my studies
                being very exciting since everything was still so new and it truly sparked my interest
                towards coding.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Since this course ended, I've been able to utilize the skills I learned in nearly every project.
                I believe this project and the course in general left me with great tools in web development.
