            <p>
            I'm Elina, currently in my third year studying Business Information Technology at 
            Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences, with a focus on Software Development. 
            I've had the pleasure of exploring Digital Design courses along the way. Coding has 
            become more than just a subject for meâ€”it's a passion I'm eager to turn into a career. 
            As I'm entering my last year of studies, I'm actively seeking opportunities for 
            internships and thesis projects in the field for the Spring of 2024!
